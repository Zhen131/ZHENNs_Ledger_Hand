# Known gaps

Known limits of this program as it stands: places where a trade it
accepts and exports may still be refused by the ledger, where two guards
stand in for each other, where a step that asks the model has a weakness
that is known but not mended, and where the book, the export or the
interface has a rough edge that is known but not yet changed. Each one is
described with the trades or passages it affects; where a choice is needed,
it waits for the project owner. How the model did in the experiments, and
what was not measured, is in `docs/project-report.md`.

## Time zone database versions

**What it is.** A trade known to the minute or second is written with its
offset from UTC and the name of its time zone, for example
`2026-10-05T05:46:00+00:00` in `Africa/Casablanca`. This program works the
offset out from Python's time zone database. The ledger checks it against the
offset its own runtime works out for that zone at that instant, and refuses
the trade when the two differ. The two databases are separate copies of the
same public data, and they are updated at different times. When one copy has
a rule change that the other does not have yet, the two offsets differ for
the zones and moments that change touches.

On the machine this was found on, Python read version 2026c of the database
and the ledger's Node runtime carried 2026a. They differed for
`Africa/Casablanca` and `Africa/El_Aaiun` from 5 October 2026 on, and for
`America/Vancouver`, `America/Edmonton`, `America/Yellowknife` and their old
names `Canada/Pacific` and `Canada/Mountain` from 2 November 2026 on.

**Which trades it affects.** Only trades known to the minute or the second,
recorded in a zone whose rules differ between the two copies at that moment.
Such a trade is accepted by this program and exported, and the ledger refuses
it with "offset must match occurredTimeZone at its instant".

**Which trades it does not affect.** Trades known only to the day: they carry
no offset, and the ledger does not check one. Trades in every zone and at
every moment where the two copies agree, which is nearly all of them.

**Why it is not fixed here.** This program cannot know which copy the ledger
will run with when the file is imported: it depends on the ledger's Node
version or browser. Each way to close the gap needs the project owner's
decision: accepting it as a known limitation, writing no time zone name (and
so losing it), or tying this program to one version of the database.

**How to see the two versions.** The ledger tier of the checks
(`scripts/check.sh ledger`) asks both sides for the offset of every timed
trade in two of its samples, reports where they differ and prints both
versions in a notice marked `!!!`. It does not count those refusals as a
failure, and it counts every other refusal as one. By hand:

```sh
cat /usr/share/zoneinfo/+VERSION                        # Python's copy, on macOS and Linux
node -e 'console.log(process.versions.tz, process.versions.icu)'   # Node's copy
```

When Python uses the `tzdata` package instead of the system's copy,
`python -c 'import tzdata; print(tzdata.IANA_VERSION)'` gives its version.

## Offsets with seconds in them

**What it is.** Before the 1970s many zones had offsets that were not a whole
number of minutes, such as `+01:16:20` in Budapest in 1890. The ledger's way
of writing a time cannot hold such an offset.

**Which trades it affects.** Only a time built directly with such an offset;
reading a time phrase never produces one. A time known only to the day
carries no offset and is not affected: 1 June 1890 in Budapest is accepted
and exported as `1890-06-01`.

**How it is handled.** The check of a draft refuses such a moment, with the
reason `OFFSET_HAS_SECONDS`, so it never becomes a record. The export keeps
its own refusal, `OFFSET_NOT_WHOLE_MINUTES`, as a second guard: a record
built some other way is refused there instead of failing while it writes.
This is no longer a gap between this program and the ledger; it stays listed
here because the two guards are easy to take for one.

## Judging a passage can stop a real trade

**What it is.** Before extraction, the model judges which kinds of thing a
passage reports (`extraction/screening.py`). When it judges that a passage
reports only things the ledger does not record (futures or leverage, one
coin swapped for another, an order not filled yet, a plan), the whole
passage is stopped and nothing is extracted. The program never lets
through a kind the model named as not recorded.

**Which passages it affects.** A passage about a real, filled spot trade
that the model takes for one of those kinds, for example because it
mentions a plan or an order in passing in a way the model reads as the
whole of it. A passage that the model judges to report a filled spot trade
as well goes on, with the rest shown as a caution.

**What the user can do.** Say it again in other words, so that the filled
trade stands out. There is no way to say "this is a spot trade, record it
anyway": whether to offer one is a decision for the project owner.

## Judging a passage has no score on the final set

**What it is.** The judging step was written and checked against the debug
set only. With `qwen2.5:7b`, the four debug sentences that report only what
the ledger does not record were each stopped, with the kind they were
written as; the 23 debug sentences with trades all went on to extraction;
of the 3 with no trade, two were judged to hold none and one was stopped as
a plan. The final set is kept for the last run of an experiment, and that
run measures extraction only, so this step has no score on sentences it
was not checked against.

**What follows from it.** Its rate of stopping a real trade, or of letting
through what is not recorded, on new passages is not measured. The live
tier of the checks runs the debug set again (`tests/live/test_live_screening.py`).

## Extraction: an English time written in Chinese

**What it is.** Asked to copy the time of an English passage, the model
sometimes writes it in Chinese: `yesterday` as `昨天`. It is the most
common reason a trade did not come out whole in the experiments
(`evals/RESULTS.md`).

**How it is handled.** The phrase is not a piece of the passage, so the
program leaves the time empty, says why, and asks for it. It costs a
question, never a wrong time. No prompt version measured so far mended it.

## Extraction: a total put as the price

**What it is.** When a passage gives what was paid in all, the model
sometimes copies that amount under price as well as, or instead of, under
total. With `first` this happened twice on the debug set, with no issue
about the field (`evals/RESULTS.md`, "A total put as the price").

**Which trades it affects.** When the draft also has a quantity and a
total, the check finds that the amounts disagree and asks which one is
wrong. When the price is the only amount, the check asks for one more of
quantity, price and total, and an answer can then make a record with that
price.

**What the user can do.** The table on the Record page shows the price and
the total side by side, so a total under price shows; "Don't save" leaves
that trade out. The prompt version `price_total` removed this error on the
debug set but lost two other trades, so the rule fixed before the
experiment did not pick it.

## Reading an answer: a word such as "about" may be dropped

**What it is.** When the rules cannot read an answer, the model copies the
piece of it that gives the value. It may leave out a word that makes the
value approximate when the word does not touch the number ("大概买了 2 个"
copied as "2 个"); the program then takes the amount as exact.

**Why it stands.** Nothing catches it: the piece is only checked to be a
piece of the answer. The prompt asks the model to keep such a word when it
stands right next to the value, and the number reader is unsure of an
amount that keeps it. How often it happens is not measured.

## The book after a write was cut off

**What it is.** When the program stops in the middle of writing the book
(the power fails, the process is killed), SQLite leaves a journal file
beside it, `ledger-hand-book.sqlite3-journal`, to roll the unfinished write
back. The program first opens the book read-only, to read its mark and
version before anything else, and a read-only connection cannot roll the
journal back. So the book is refused as inaccessible, every time.

**What it affects.** Nothing is lost: the book and its journal hold every
trade saved before. But the program cannot use the book until the journal
is rolled back.

**What the user can do.** Keep a copy of the book and its journal file
together, then open the book once with a SQLite tool that may write to it;
SQLite rolls the journal back by itself. Do not delete the journal file.

**Why it is not fixed here.** Rolling the journal back from the program
means writing to a file before its mark and version are read, which the
rule that a refused file is never written to forbids. Whether to bend that
rule for this one case is a decision for the project owner.

## A change in the time zone database can stop listing and exporting

**What it is.** A trade known to the minute or second is kept with its
offset from UTC and its zone. Reading it back checks the offset against the
zone's rules in the time zone database Python uses then. If a later version
of that database changes the rules of that zone at that moment, the trade no
longer reads back, and every reading of the book that reaches that trade
reports the book damaged: no trade can be listed, and while that trade is
not exported yet, nothing can be exported either. Saving new trades, the
reminder of a passage saved before and the coins confirmed still work, and
once that trade has been exported, the trades not exported yet are exported
as usual.

**Which trades it affects.** Only trades known to the minute or second,
recorded in a zone to which a later version of the database gives another
offset at that moment than the version they were recorded with. Trades
known only to the day carry no offset and are not affected.

**Why it is not fixed here.** Reading such a trade back with a caution,
instead of failing every reading that reaches it, changes what the book
promises about the trades it keeps; the project owner has left it for
later. It shares its root with "Time zone database versions" above.

## Exporting needs hard links

**What it is.** An export file is written under a temporary name and then
given its own name with a hard link, which fails instead of replacing a
file of that name. On a file system without hard links (some removable
drives and network drives), every export fails as not written.

**What it affects.** Nothing is marked as exported when the file is not
written, so nothing is lost; the trades wait for the next export.

**What the user can do.** Point `LEDGER_HAND_DATA_DIR` at a folder on a disk
that has hard links.

## The interface: three sentences that could be better

- **A model that is not there, on a cloud service.** The sentence for a
  model the server does not have also suggests installing it with
  `ollama pull`, which applies to the local Ollama only. The sentence is
  shared by both plugs.
- **The model failing while it reads an answer.** The question is asked
  again and nothing breaks, but the sentence ends with the failure's kind as
  a code word, such as `(timed_out)`, rather than in plain words. The flow
  does not keep the kind for the interface to look up.
- **A setting refused in the environment.** The Settings page opens and
  names the setting and its rule, but the setting cannot be corrected there:
  the environment variable has to be corrected and the program started
  again.

## The experiment tools and cloud settings

**What it is.** The experiment tools (`evals/run.py`) always use the local
plug, because they ask Ollama itself for the model's fingerprint, but they
read the address and the key from the settings. Run with cloud settings
left in the shell, they send Ollama's own requests, with that key, to the
cloud address, where they only fail.

**What the user can do.** Unset the cloud settings before running an
experiment (the README says so). Refusing to run with them set is a change
still to be made.
